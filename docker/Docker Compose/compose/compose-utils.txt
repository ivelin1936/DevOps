Should we want, we can start the service again but this time in detached mode with
docker compose up -d

And then check the list of working containers
docker container ls

We can use the following to get the list of services
docker compose ps

And this one to see the list of processes by service
docker compose top

Should we want to see the logs (as we saw them when our session was attached), we can use
docker compose logs

Letâ€™s stop the service
docker compose down
