##  Homework M7: Elastic Stack

### Tasks
Utilizing what was discussed and shown during the lecture, try to do the following:
1. Build an infrastructure with three machines - one server for the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) and two clients - one with CentOS and one with Ubuntu. For the server you can use either CentOS or Ubuntu
2. Install Metricbeat on the two client machines and make sure that the system module is enabled
3. Configure the Logstash to receive data from the beats and to forward the data to Elasticsearch
4. Using the REST API create an index pattern in Kibana

* Please note that your solution should be automated to the extent possible

### Proof
Prepare a document that show what you accomplished and how you did it. It can include (not limited to):
1. The commands you used to achieve the above tasks
2. Any configuration files produced while solving the tasks
3. A few pictures showing intermediary steps or results
